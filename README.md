## General Information
This project was made as a school project in [kood/JÃµhvi](https://kood.tech/) (12.7.2023)

The project required me to create a microservice architecture which included a gateway, a message queue system RabbitMQ & 2 other services with their own PostgreSQL instances. The infrastructure had to be provisioned by Vagrant. The gateway and microservices were all written using Node.js .

  **NB! Different source control platform was used hence no commit history.**

## Features
